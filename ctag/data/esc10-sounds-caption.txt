Gentle raindrops pitter-patter on the window pane, generating a soothing melody.
A baby wails, filling the air with high-pitched cries for attention or comfort.
A clock ticks steadily, marking the passing seconds with a quiet, rhythmic sound.
A sudden sneeze interrupts the silence, brief but loud.
A rooster crows at dawn, its loud call echoing across the farmyard.
Sea waves crash against the shore, creating a powerful, rhythmic roar.
